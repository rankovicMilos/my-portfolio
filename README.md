# My Portfolio

A minimalist portfolio site built with Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, and TypeScript. It uses the App Router, optimized fonts via `next/font`, and ships dark-mode friendly defaults so you can focus on showcasing your work.

## Features

- App Router + TypeScript setup with layout metadata and global styles ready to customize.
- Responsive landing page scaffold with dark/light styling and CTA blocks.
